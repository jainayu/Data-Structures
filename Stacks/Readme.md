# Stacks 

Stacks are dynamic data structures that follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The last item to be inserted into a stack is the first one to be deleted from it. 

- Inserting and deleting elements

Stacks have restrictions on the insertion and deletion of elements. Elements can be inserted or deleted only from one end of the stack i.e. from the *top*. The operations of inserting and deleting elements are called *push()* and *pop()* respectively. 

- Features of stacks

	- Dynamic data structures
	- Do not have a fixed size
	- Do not consume a fixed amount of memory
	- Size of stack changes with each *push()* and *pop()* operation. Each *push()* and *pop()* operation increases and decreases the size of the stack by , respectively.
