## Searching Algorithms

#### Linear Search

Linear search is used on a collections of items. It relies on the technique of traversing a list from start to end by exploring properties of all the elements that are found on the way.

#### Binary Search

Binary search is the most popular Search algorithm.It is efficient and also one of the most commonly used techniques that is used to solve problems.
 
Binary search works only on a sorted set of elements. To use binary search on a collection, the collection must first be sorted. 

As we dispose off one part of the search case during every step of binary search, and perform the search operation on the other half, this results in a worst case time complexity of O(log<sub>2</sub>(N)).
