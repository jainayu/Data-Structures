# Queues

Queues are data structures that follow the First In First Out (FIFO) i.e. the first element that is added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

Elements are always added to the back and removed from the front.

The standard queue data structure has the following variations:

- **Double-ended queue** (click [here](https://github.com/jainayu/Data-Structures/blob/master/Queues/doubleEndedQueue.cpp) to see the implementation)
	
	In a standard queue, a character is inserted at the back and deleted in the front. However, in a double-ended queue, characters can be inserted and deleted from both the front and back of the queue.
	
- **Circular queue** (click [here](https://github.com/jainayu/Data-Structures/blob/master/Queues/circularQueue.cpp) to see the implementation)
	
	A circular queue is an improvement over the standard queue structure. In a standard queue, when an element is deleted, the vacant space is not reutilized. However, in a circular queue, vacant spaces are reutilized.
