# Data Structures and Algorithms

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. And algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

*All the codes completed and examples or syntax quoted are in the C++ programming language.*
